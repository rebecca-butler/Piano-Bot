# Piano-bot
The Piano Bot was inspired by young children who wish to experiment with musical composition. 

Many children have difficulty distinguishing the positions of notes on a musical staff, but they can easily recognize colours. We designed a robot that would allow children to use colours to represent notes when composing. The robot uses a sensor to detect the colours, translates the colours to notes, and plays the song by hitting keys on a piano phone app.

This project was created through the use of RobotC, Android Studio, 3D printers, laser cutting machines, and a Lego EV3 Mindstorm robot.

Several tests were conducted to further analyze and improve the accuracy of the robot. These test cases involved the colour sensor, motors, and alignment of the robot. Prior to finalizing the design concept, experiments were completed in order to test the output values from the colour sensor, the accuracy and power of the motors, and the potential chances of off-centered driving.
